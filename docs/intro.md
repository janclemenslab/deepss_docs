# Welcome to _DeepSS_
_DeepSS_ --- short for _DeepSongSegmenter_ --- is a tool for annotating song in audio recordings. At the core of _DeepSS_ is a deep neural network, implemented in Tensorflow. The network takes single- and multi-channel audio as an input and returns the probability of finding a particular song type for each audio sample. _DeepSS_ can be used with a graphical user interface for loading audio data, annotating song manually, training a network, and generating annotations on new samples and recordings. _DeepSS_ can also be used programmatically from the command line, in python notebooks, or in your own python code via the _dss_ module.
